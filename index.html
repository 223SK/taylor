    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <img src="images/programming.gif" width= 100%>
    <p>  Hello, my name is Taylor Hawkins. I am in a family of 11, 9 children and 2 adults. I am a student athlete that currently plays Cross-Country, Basketball, and Softball. I also play Football but I am not on a school team since I am a girl. I love sports, with an undying passion. I honestly believe that sports are the reason as to why I keep my grades up and don't get into any fights that can risk me playing. Sports keep me sane and I'm glad to be on such amazing teams with very talented students.</p>
    <p>  I am also very fond of reading. I love reading. My favorite author would be John Green, his books are amazing and so heart-felt. One of my favorite books would be Looking For Alaska by John Green. This book is so deep and mysterious. It gives off an idea that it's not about how long you knew the person, it's about how much they had an effect on you during that time you knew them. I honestly believe it is really amazing.Reading in general is pretty amazing. It helps get my mind off things and gives me a chance to see other perspectives in life. </p>
    <p> I have things to live for. One thing I am most proud of was being short-stop on the MS.223 Lady Eagles Softball Team of 2012-2013, playing right next to my sister, Skylar Hawkins. She's someone I look up to when it comes to Softball and I am proud to call her my sister. Andrew Hawkins, my brother is also one of the people I look up to when it comes to sports because he's determined and so strong, I want to inherit that. He pushes me to do better and I can't thank him eough. Samantha Hawkins, my older sister is like my other half she is someone I look up to most of all. She's been there for me and words can't explain how she's apart of my life and how important she is to me.
